The Mormons are trying to find new followers and in order to do that they embark on missions.

Each time they go on a mission, each Mormon converts a fixed number of people
(reach) into followers. This continues and every freshly converted Mormon as well
as every original Mormon go on another mission and convert the same fixed number
of people each. The process continues until they reach a predefined target number
of followers (target).

Converted Mormons are unique so that there's no duplication amongst them.

Complete the function that calculates how many missions Mormons need to embark on,
in order to reach their target. While each correct solution will pass, for more
fun try to make a recursive function.

All inputs are valid positive integers.
Examples

starting_number = 10, reach = 3, target = 9  -->  0
# No missions needed because the number of followers already exceeds target

starting_number = 40, reach = 2, target = 120  -->  1
# Every mormon converts 2 people, so after 1 mission there are 40 + 80 = 120 mormons

starting_number = 20_000, reach = 2, target = 7_000_000_000  -->  12
# Mormons dominate the world after only 12 missions! */


function proselytize(startingNumber, reach, target, mission) {
  if (target <= startingNumber) {
    return mission
  }

  mission++

  return proselytize(startingNumber + reach * startingNumber, reach, target, mission)
}

function mormons(startingNumber, reach, target) {
  return proselytize(startingNumber, reach, target, 0)
}

console.log(mormons(10, 3, 9));
console.log(mormons(40, 2, 120));
console.log(mormons(20000, 2, 7_000_000_000));
