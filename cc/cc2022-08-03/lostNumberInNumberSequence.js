// Lost number in number sequence


// An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

// Example:

// The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
// The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
// Your function should return the int 5.
// If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

// Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

const findDeletedNumber = (arr, mixArr)=> {
    const a = arr.concat(mixArr)
    return a.filter(x=> a.indexOf(x) == a.lastIndexOf(x))[0] || 0
  }
