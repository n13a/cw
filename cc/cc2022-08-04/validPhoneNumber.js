// Valid Phone Number 

// Write a function that accepts a string, and returns true if it is in the form of a phone number.
// Assume that any integer from 0-9 in any of the spots will produce a valid phone number.

// Only worry about the following format:
// (123) 456-7890 (don't forget the space after the close parentheses)

// Examples:

// "(123) 456-7890"  => true
// "(1111)555 2345"  => false
// "(098) 123 4567"  => false


const validPhoneNumber = n => /^\(\d\d\d\) \d\d\d-\d\d\d\d$/.test(n)
