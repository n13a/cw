/* Human readable duration format

Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

It is much easier to understand with an example:

For seconds = 62, your function should return 
    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
For seconds = 3662, your function should return
    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds"

For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.

Note that spaces are important.
Detailed rules

The resulting expression is made of components like 4 seconds, 1 year, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.

The components are separated by a comma and a space (", "). Except the last component, which is separated by " and ", just like it would be written in English.

A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, 1 second and 1 year is not correct, but 1 year and 1 second is.

Different components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in 5 seconds and 1 second.

A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, 1 minute and 0 seconds is not valid, but it should be just 1 minute.

A unit of time must be used "as much as possible". It means that the function should not return 61 seconds, but 1 minute and 1 second instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.

    s -= d * 3600 * 24
    const h = Math.floor(s / 3600)
    s -= h * 3600
    const m = Math.floor(s / 60)
    s -= m * 60
    const raw = [`${y} year`, `${d} day`, `${h} hour`, `${m} minute`, `${s} second`]
        .filter(z => z[0] != 0)
        .map(x => {
            const a = x.split(' ')
            if (a[0] > 1) {
                a[1] += 's'
            }
            return a
        })
    let res = raw.map(x => x.join(' '))
    if (res.length == 1) return res[0]
    return res.slice(0, res.length - 1).join(', ') + ' and ' + res[res.length - 1]
}
