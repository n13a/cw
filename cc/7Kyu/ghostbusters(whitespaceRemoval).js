// Ghostbusters (whitespace removal)


// Oh no! Ghosts have reportedly swarmed the city. It's your job to get rid of them and save the day!

// In this kata, strings represent buildings while whitespaces within those strings represent ghosts.

// So what are you waiting for? Return the building(string) without any ghosts(whitespaces)!

// Example:

// ghostBusters("Sky scra per");

// Should return:

// "Skyscraper"

// If the building contains no ghosts, return the string:

// "You just wanted my autograph didn't you?"

const ghostBusters = building => building.includes(' ') ?
    building.split(' ').join('') :
    "You just wanted my autograph didn't you?"
