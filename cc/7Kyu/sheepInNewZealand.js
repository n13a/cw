// Count all the sheep on farm in the heights of New Zealand

// Every Friday and Saturday night, farmer counts amount of sheep returned back to his farm (sheep returned on Friday stay and don't leave for a weekend).

// Sheep return in groups each of the days -> you will be given two arrays with these numbers (one for Friday and one for Saturday night). Entries are always positive ints, higher than zero.

// Farmer knows the total amount of sheep, this is a third parameter. You need to return the amount of sheep lost (not returned to the farm) after final sheep counting on Saturday.

// Example 1: Input: {1, 2}, {3, 4}, 15 --> Output: 5

// Example 2: Input: {3, 1, 2}, {4, 5}, 21 --> Output: 6

// Good luck! :-)


const lostSheep = (f, s, t) => t - (f.reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0) + s.reduce((a, c) => a + c, 0))
