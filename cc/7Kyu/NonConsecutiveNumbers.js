// Find all non - consecutive numbers
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/58f8b35fda19c0c79400020f/train/javascript


// Your task is to find all the elements of an array that are non consecutive.

// A number is non consecutive if it is not exactly one larger than the previous element in the array.The first element gets a pass and is never considered non consecutive.

// Create a function named allNonConsecutive

// E.g., if we have an array[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 15, 16] then 6 and 15 are non - consecutive.

// You should return the results as an array of objects with two values i: <the index of the non-consecutive number> and n: <the non-consecutive number>.

//     E.g., for the above array the result should be:

//     [
//     {i: 4, n:6},
//     {i: 7, n:15}
//     ]

//     If the whole array is consecutive or has one element then return an empty array.

//     The array elements will all be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive and/or negetive and the gap could be larger than one.

    let res = []

            res.push({ i: i + 1, n: arr[i + 1] })
        }
    }
    return res
