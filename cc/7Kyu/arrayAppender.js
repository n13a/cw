Write a function that appends the items from sequence 2 onto sequence 1, returning the newly formed sequence. Your function should also be able to handle nested sequences.

All inputs will be arrays/nested arrays.

For example:

['a','b','c'], [1,2,3]     --> ['a','b','c',1,2,3]
[['x','x'],'B'], ['c','D'] --> [['x','x'],'B','c','D']

*/


const appendArrays = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2)
