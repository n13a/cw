Task

You are given two numbers a and b where 0 ≤ a ≤ b. Imagine you construct an array of all the integers from a to b inclusive. You need to count the number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers in the array.
Example

For a = 2 and b = 7, the output should be 11

Given a = 2 and b = 7 the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Converting the numbers to binary, we get [10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111], which contains 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11 1s.
Input/Output

    [input] integer a

Constraints: 0 ≤ a ≤ b.

    [input] integer b

Constraints: a ≤ b ≤ 100.

    [output] an integer

  const ar = [...new Array(b + 1 - a).keys()].map(x => x + a)
  const bin = ar.map(x => x.toString(2)).join('')
  return bin.match(/1/g).length
}
