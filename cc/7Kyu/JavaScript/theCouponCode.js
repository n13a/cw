// The Coupon Code

// Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.
// Task

// Your mission:
// Write a function called checkCoupon which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.

// A coupon is no more valid on the day AFTER the expiration date. All dates will be passed as strings in this format: "MONTH DATE, YEAR".
// Examples:

// checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===  true
// checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ===  false


const checkCoupon = (ec, cc, cd, ed) => ec === cc && new Date(cd) <= new Date(ed)
