// You love coffee and want to know what beans you can afford to buy it.

// The first argument to your search function will be a number which represents your budget.

// The second argument will be an array of coffee bean prices.

// Your 'search' function should return the stores that sell coffee within your budget.

// The search function should return a string of prices for the coffees beans you can afford. The prices in this string are to be sorted in ascending order.


const search = (budget, prices) => prices.filter(x => x <= budget).sort((a, b) => a - b).join(',')
