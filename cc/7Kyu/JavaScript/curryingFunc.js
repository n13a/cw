// Currying functions: multiply all elements in an array



// To complete this Kata you need to make a function multiplyAll/multiply_all which takes an array of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array.

// The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.

// Example:

// multiplyAll([1, 2, 3])(2) = [2, 4, 6];

// You must not mutate the original array.


const multiplyAll = arr => (n) => arr.map(x => x * n)
