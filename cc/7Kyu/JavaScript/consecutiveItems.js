// Consecutive items

// You are given a list of unique integers arr, and two integers a and b. Your task is to find out whether or not a and b appear consecutively in arr, and return a boolean value (True if a and b are consecutive, False otherwise).

// It is guaranteed that a and b are both present in arr.


const consecutive = (arr, a, b) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == a && arr[i + 1] == b || arr[i] == b && arr[i + 1] == a) return true
    }
    return false
