// When a function is called by itself it is bound to the global context; the this variable of the function will be bound to the global object.

// When the getNameFunc function is called on the alpha object the value of the name variable outside of the object is returned: "The Window".

// We do not want this, we want the value of the name property inside the alpha object to be returned.

// Fix getNameFunc so the right value is returned.


name = 'The Window';

var alpha = {
  name: 'My Alpha',
  getNameFunc: function () {
    return () => {
      return this.name;
    };
  }
