// You have an array of numbers 1 through n (where 1 <= n <= 10). The array needs to be formatted correctly for the person reading the countdown of a spaceship launch.

// Unfortunately, the person reading the countdown only knows how to read strings. After the array is sorted correctly make sure it's in a format he can understand.

// Between each number should be a space and after the final number (n) should be the word 'liftoff!'

// Example:

// Given
// instructions = [8,1,10,2,7,9,6,3,4,5]
// Should return
// "10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!"
// Given
// instructions = [1,2,4,3,5]
// Should return
// "5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!"


function liftoff(instructions) {
    return instructions.sort((a, b) => b - a).join(' ') + ' liftoff!'
}
